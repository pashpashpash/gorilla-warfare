# The Cycle of Seasons

## Spring's Awakening

The earth awakens from its winter sleep,
As tender shoots push through the softened ground,
And birds return to sing their songs so sweet,
While gentle rains bring life to all around.

The cherry blossoms dance upon the breeze,
Their petals falling like a fragrant snow,
The world transforms with such graceful ease,
As nature's palette starts its vibrant show.

Young creatures frolic in the warming light,
Their playful antics bringing joy to all,
As days grow longer, pushing back the night,
And life responds to spring's enchanting call.

The promise of renewal fills the air,
As winter's grip releases day by day,
The world emerges from its long despair,
As spring leads life along its verdant way.

## Summer's Glory

The sun ascends to claim its rightful throne,
And bathes the world in golden, warming light,
The days stretch out, the longest we have known,
Before surrendering to shorter night.

The gardens burst with colors rich and bold,
As flowers reach to touch the azure sky,
Their beauty more than eyes can ever hold,
A feast for every passing butterfly.

The ocean calls with cool refreshing waves,
While children laugh and play upon the shore,
The heat of day makes everyone its slaves,
Yet summer's bounty offers so much more.

The evening brings relief from scorching sun,
As fireflies dance their silent, glowing waltz,
The stars emerge when day is finally done,
While summer dreams forgive all human faults.

## Autumn's Reflection

The trees transform in fiery display,
Their leaves ablaze in crimson, gold, and rust,
The cooling air brings change from day to day,
As nature shows that change is always just.

The harvest moon hangs heavy in the sky,
While farmers gather crops with grateful hands,
The geese form perfect arrows as they fly,
To warmer homes in distant southern lands.

The morning frost creates its silver art,
On window panes and fields of fading green,
As autumn plays its bittersweet part,
In nature's cycle, ever changing scene.

The world prepares for winter's coming chill,
As creatures store their food and build their nests,
The land grows quiet, peaceful, calm and still,
As autumn gently puts the year to rest.

## Winter's Slumber

The first snow falls in silent, soft descent,
Transforming landscapes into crystal dreams,
The world now draped in white magnificence,
As winter's touch enhances all it seems.

The hearth becomes the center of the home,
Where stories shared bring hearts and minds together,
While outside, those who choose to roam,
Must bundle tight against the bitter weather.

The frozen lakes reflect the pale blue sky,
As skaters glide across the mirrored glass,
The shortest days too quickly passing by,
As winter holds the world within its grasp.

Yet deep beneath the snow, life waits to rise,
When spring returns to start the cycle new,
For nature in its wisdom never dies,
But rests awhile, then emerges true.

## The Eternal Cycle

And so the seasons turn, year after year,
Each bringing gifts unique and wholly theirs,
Teaching lessons both profound and clear,
About life's journey and its joys and cares.

For in the seasons, we can see our lives,
The spring of youth, the summer of our prime,
The autumn when our wisdom truly thrives,
And winter's rest at the closing of our time.

Yet like the earth, our essence never ends,
But changes form to join the greater whole,
As each life lived its energy lends,
To feed the cycle of the cosmic soul.

So celebrate each season as it comes,
Embrace its beauty, learn its special truth,
For in their endless turning, life becomes,
A masterpiece of age and vibrant youth.
