# The Jungle King

## An Epic Tale of the Mighty Gorilla

I.
Deep in the emerald heart of ancient lands,
Where mist-veiled mountains touch the morning sky,
A kingdom thrives beneath the forest's hands,
Where shadows dance and wild rivers fly.
The jungle breathes with life at every turn,
Its secrets kept by guardians old and wise,
Where nature's laws are all one needs to learn,
And strength is measured not by human size.

Among the verdant canopy and vine,
A presence moves with dignity and grace,
The jungle king, whose lineage divine
Has ruled this wild and sacred, timeless place.
The mighty gorilla, with eyes profound,
Surveys his realm with thoughtful, watchful gaze,
His thunderous chest-beat echoes all around,
Commanding respect through ancient, primal ways.

His massive arms, like living oaken boughs,
Could bend the strongest saplings with their might,
Yet gentle hands will pluck the tenderest sprouts,
With care that puts the surgeon's skill to flight.
His back of silver, badge of wisdom earned
Through seasons countless as the stars above,
The battles fought, the lessons harshly learned,
The clan protected with unyielding love.

II.
The morning breaks across the mountain spine,
As golden light spills through the misty veil,
The silverback rises, a living shrine
To primal power that time cannot assail.
He leads his family through the forest deep,
To feeding grounds where tender shoots await,
While watchful eyes eternal vigil keep
For dangers that might threaten his estate.

The younglings tumble in his mighty wake,
Their playful antics bringing silent mirth,
Each lesson that the elders choose to make
Prepares them for their place upon this earth.
The mothers watch with patience born of love,
Their gentle hands guide each adventurous child,
While overhead, the canopy above
Protects them all from elements too wild.

The day unfolds in peaceful, measured pace,
As leaves are stripped and tender stems consumed,
Each member knows their designated place,
In social bonds that cannot be presumed.
The silverback sits in contemplation deep,
His thoughtful eyes scan horizons far,
The memories that only he will keep,
Of times when man and beast were still at war.

III.
For in the world beyond their forest home,
A different creature walks on two, not four,
With clever hands and minds that always roam,
Inventing tools for peace and tools for war.
These hairless apes, with languages complex,
Have spread across the planet's every shore,
Their endless needs the wilderness perplex,
As forests fall to their unceasing roar.

The silverback has seen their kind before,
The flash of metal, thunder without rain,
The scent of death that lingers evermore,
Where human footprints mark the terrain.
He's watched his brothers fall to distant fire,
Their mighty bodies crumpling to the ground,
Has felt the sting of human's strange desire
To claim what cannot truly be their own.

Yet some have come with different intent,
With quiet steps and reverent, watchful eyes,
Their time among his family gently spent,
Observing ways that made them truly wise.
These humans learned what others failed to see:
The complex lives that mirror their own kind,
The bonds of love and loyalty set free,
The depth of gorilla heart and mind.

IV.
As twilight settles on the jungle floor,
The silverback leads to their nightly nest,
Where woven branches form a natural door
Against the dangers lurking without rest.
The family settles in their leafy beds,
The younglings curled against maternal warmth,
While overhead, the starlight gently spreads
A blanket woven from the universe's cloth.

The silverback sits upright, ever guard,
His silhouette against the rising moon,
His duty to protect is never marred
By weariness that comes both late and soon.
His thoughts, if one could read such primal mind,
Might wander paths of memory and dream,
Of ancestors whose legacy defined
The very essence of his being's stream.

He contemplates the changes in his land,
The shrinking borders of his wild domain,
The future that he cannot understand,
Where gorilla kind might never reign again.
Yet in his heart, a stubborn hope remains,
That humans might at last come to perceive
The brotherhood that flows through common veins,
A truth that might their savage ways relieve.

V.
The seasons turn like great wheels in the sky,
The rains arrive to swell the forest's heart,
The younglings grow as months and years pass by,
Some stay, while others make their own fresh start.
The silverback's once midnight coat now shows
More strands of silver with each passing day,
His movements, though still powerful, disclose
The weight of time that none can hold at bay.

Young males, once playful at his patient feet,
Now challenge with their own emerging strength,
Their chest-beats bold, refusing all defeat,
Will drive them from the family at length.
For such is nature's way to spread the seed,
To forge new families across the land,
Ensuring gorilla blood will still proceed
Through future forests they cannot yet understand.

The daughters stay, their gentle presence brings
A continuity of female line,
Their offspring born beneath protective wings
Of family bonds both human and divine.
The silverback watches with quiet pride
As generations flourish in his care,
His legacy in each young life allied
With ancient codes that all gorillas share.

VI.
One dawn arrives with unexpected sound,
The crack of branches, voices harsh and strange,
The scent of humans taints the air around,
Portending days of unavoidable change.
The silverback rises to his full height,
His massive frame a bulwark 'gainst all harm,
He pounds his chest with all his fearsome might,
A primal warning bell, a loud alarm.

The family scatters at his urgent call,
The mothers clutching younglings to their breast,
While he remains, a living, breathing wall
Between his loved ones and unwelcome guest.
The humans pause, their weapons lowered slow,
As recognition dawns in human eyes,
This is no beast, but being they should know
As kin beneath the same expansive skies.

For in that moment, frozen like a frame
Of film that captures truth too swift to see,
The humans glimpse what brings them greatest shame:
A mirror of what they once used to be.
The dignity, the courage without name,
The selfless love that risks a certain death,
Reminds these humans of their higher aim
Beyond mere conquest's shallow, fleeting breath.

VII.
They lower guns and step with caution back,
Their mission changed by unexpected grace,
The silverback watches their slow retreat,
Confusion etched upon his weathered face.
For all his years of human interaction,
This outcome stands unique in memory's hall,
A moment of unspoken satisfaction
That might presage a change to benefit all.

The humans leave, but others soon return,
With different tools and reverent approach,
They come to study, understand and learn,
Not to exploit, to kill, or to encroach.
They mark the boundaries of protected land,
Where gorillas might in safety dwell,
A sanctuary, carefully planned,
Where ancient ways might flourish and excel.

The silverback observes these strange events
With wisdom born of many seasons passed,
He cannot know their ultimate intents,
But senses change that might forever last.
He leads his family through familiar trails,
Their daily rhythms largely undisturbed,
While human guardians ensure what fails
Elsewhere will here remain uncurbed.

VIII.
The years flow on like rivers to the sea,
The silverback grows older day by day,
His movements slow, yet still with dignity,
He guides his family in the ancient way.
The silver on his back now fully spread,
A crown of age that marks his noble reign,
The wisdom in his eyes has only bred
A deeper understanding, free from pain.

One morning, as the sun begins to rise,
The silverback does not rise with the light,
His family gathers with mournful cries,
Around the form that fought its final fight.
The jungle king has passed beyond this realm,
To join the spirits of his ancestors old,
His body now will nurture elm and helm,
Returning to the earth that made him bold.

Yet death is not an ending, but a turn,
In life's eternal, ever-spinning wheel,
The lessons that the silverback did learn
Live on in those who still can think and feel.
His sons now lead their families with care,
His daughters raise their young with tender might,
His legacy continues everywhere
That gorillas walk in morning light.

IX.
And what of humans in this ancient tale?
Some still bring death with thoughtless, greedy hands,
While others fight that gorillas might prevail,
Protecting what remains of forest lands.
The battle wages on from day to day,
Between destruction and conservation's call,
The outcome hanging in uncertain sway,
With consequences dire for one and all.

For should the mighty gorilla disappear,
A light goes out that cannot be relit,
A wisdom lost that took countless years
To form and flourish in the forest's pit.
And humans too would lose a precious link
To understanding their own primal past,
A mirror that might help them stop and think
About the future and how long they'll last.

The jungle king's tale serves to remind
That greatness dwells in unexpected forms,
That dignity and strength are not confined
To those who speak or write or follow norms.
That in the heart of wilderness untamed,
A noble spirit lives that we should heed,
A being worthy to be proudly named
As brother to humanity indeed.

X.
So listen to the echo in the hills,
The distant thunder of a chest being beat,
A sound that even now the forest fills
With power that no human can defeat.
Remember that the jungle has its king,
A sovereign whose rule is just and true,
Whose legacy continues on to bring
A hope for futures we may never view.

The mighty gorilla, jungle royalty,
Whose kingdom shrinks with each passing year,
Deserves our respect and our loyalty,
Our protection and our solemn tear.
For in saving him, we save ourselves as well,
A truth that some have yet to understand,
A lesson that the wise ones seek to tell
Before the last gorilla leaves the land.

So ends this tale, but not the greater story
Of life that struggles on against all odds,
Of creatures fighting not for fame or glory
But simply to exist as nature's gods.
The jungle king still reigns where forests stand,
His thunderous voice still echoes through the trees,
A living testament to life so grand
That even death cannot its wonder seize.
